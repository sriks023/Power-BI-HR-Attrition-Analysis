## Project Overview

This project involves the creation of an interactive dashboard in Power BI to analyze HR data for a company with 1,470 employees. The primary objective is to identify key factors driving employee attrition and to provide a clear overview of the company's workforce composition.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis is [here](https://github.com/sriks023/Power-BI-HR-Attrition-Analysis/blob/main/HR%20Analytics%20Data_Exp11%20(2).csv). It contains employee information such as job role, age, gender, education level, and attrition status.

## Tools Used

* **Power BI:** For data modelling, analysis, and dashboard creation.
* **Microsoft Excel:** For initial data cleaning and preparation (if applicable).

### ðŸ“ˆ Dashboard Interpretation & Key Insights

Here is a detailed breakdown of the findings from the HR analysis dashboard.

#### **Overall Workforce Summary**
* **Total Employees**: The company has a total of 1,470 employees[cite: 10, 57].
* **Gender Distribution**: The `Sum of EmployeeCount by Age and Gender` chart indicates that male employees represent a larger portion of the workforce[cite: 70, 71]. [cite_start]Within the group of employees who left, males (150) outnumber females (87)[cite: 64, 65, 68, 69].
* **Age Distribution**: The largest concentration of employees appears to be in the 30 to 40 age range [cite: 90, 91][cite_start], with the distribution peaking around age 35[cite: 70].

#### **Job Roles & Departments**
* **Largest Departments**: The most populous job roles are "Sales Executive" with 326 employees [cite: 51, 56][cite_start], "Research Scientist" with 292 employees [cite: 48, 57][cite_start], and "Laboratory Technician" with 259 employees[cite: 21, 26].
* **Smallest Departments**: The job roles with the fewest employees are "Human Resources" with 52 employees [cite: 15, 20] [cite_start]and "Research Director" with 80 employees[cite: 39, 46].

#### **Attrition Analysis**
* **Overall Attrition**: The total attrition count is 237 employees[cite: 63, 64, 65].
* **Attrition by Gender**: Males account for 63.29% of total attrition (150 employees) [cite: 65, 66, 68][cite_start], while females account for the remaining 36.71% (87 employees)[cite: 64, 66, 69].
* **Attrition by Education Level**: The data reveals a significant trend where employees with **Education Level '3'** have the highest number of attritions at 99[cite: 78, 88]. [cite_start]The next highest groups are Education Level '2' with 44 attritions [cite: 84, 85] and Education Level '1' with 31 attritions[cite: 86, 87]. This suggests a potential retention problem for employees with these specific education backgrounds, particularly level 3.
