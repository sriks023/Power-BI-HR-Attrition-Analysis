## Project Overview

This project involves the creation of an interactive dashboard in Power BI to analyze HR data for a company with 1,470 employees. The primary objective is to identify key factors driving employee attrition and to provide a clear overview of the company's workforce composition.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis is https://github.com/sriks023/Power-BI-HR-Attrition-Analysis/blob/main/HR%20Analytics%20Data_Exp11%20(2).csv. It contains employee information such as job role, age, gender, education level, and attrition status.

## Tools Used

* **Power BI:** For data modelling, analysis, and dashboard creation.
* **Microsoft Excel:** For initial data cleaning and preparation (if applicable).

## Dashboard Interpretation & Key Insights
